# Deployment Guide for Vercel

## ‚úÖ Communication Status

Your micro-frontends are now **fully configured** to communicate on production (Vercel)!

---

## üöÄ What Was Fixed

### Before
- ‚ùå CHAT and EMAIL had NO PostMessage communication
- ‚ùå Apps would load in iframes but couldn't talk to HOST
- ‚ùå No bi-directional communication on Vercel

### After
- ‚úÖ CHAT sends/receives PostMessage to/from HOST
- ‚úÖ EMAIL sends/receives PostMessage to/from HOST
- ‚úÖ All user actions are tracked and sent to HOST
- ‚úÖ HOST displays notifications for all micro-frontend actions
- ‚úÖ Works on both localhost AND Vercel

---

## üì¶ Deployment to Vercel

### Option 1: Deploy All Three Apps (Recommended)

1. **Create 3 Vercel Projects**:
   - `bluebash-host` (for /host)
   - `bluebash-chat` (for /chat)
   - `bluebash-email` (for /email)

2. **Deploy HOST**:
   ```bash
   cd host
   vercel --prod
   ```
   - Note the deployed URL: `https://bluebash-host.vercel.app`

3. **Deploy CHAT**:
   ```bash
   cd chat
   vercel --prod
   ```
   - Note the deployed URL: `https://bluebash-chat.vercel.app`

4. **Deploy EMAIL**:
   ```bash
   cd email
   vercel --prod
   ```
   - Note the deployed URL: `https://bluebash-email.vercel.app`

5. **Update HOST Environment Variables**:

   In Vercel dashboard for HOST project, add:
   ```
   VITE_CHAT_URL=https://bluebash-chat.vercel.app
   VITE_EMAIL_URL=https://bluebash-email.vercel.app
   ```

6. **Redeploy HOST** to pick up environment variables

---

### Option 2: Deploy HOST Only (Quick Demo)

If you just want to demo the HOST app without micro-frontends:

```bash
cd host
vercel --prod
```

The HOST app will work standalone, but chat/email modals will try to load from localhost (won't work).

---

## üîí Security Configuration for Production

### Update PostMessage Origins

After deploying, update the hardcoded `'*'` origins with actual URLs:

#### In CHAT (chat/src/App.tsx)

Find:
```typescript
// Security: In production, verify event.origin
// if (event.origin !== 'https://host-app.vercel.app') return;
```

Uncomment and update with your actual HOST URL:
```typescript
if (event.origin !== 'https://bluebash-host.vercel.app') return;
```

Also update the postMessage calls:
```typescript
window.parent.postMessage({...}, 'https://bluebash-host.vercel.app');
```

#### In EMAIL (email/src/App.tsx)

Same changes as CHAT:
```typescript
if (event.origin !== 'https://bluebash-host.vercel.app') return;
window.parent.postMessage({...}, 'https://bluebash-host.vercel.app');
```

#### In HOST (host/src/components/MicroFrontendModal.tsx)

Update the postMessage target origin:
```typescript
iframeRef.current.contentWindow.postMessage(
  {...},
  'https://bluebash-chat.vercel.app'  // or email URL
);
```

## üß™ Testing on Vercel

### 1. Open Deployed HOST App
Navigate to `https://bluebash-host.vercel.app`

### 2. Open Browser DevTools Console

### 3. Click "Open in Modal (iframe)" for Chat

### 4. Watch for Console Logs:
```
[CHAT] Received message from HOST: {type: "HOST_CONNECTED", ...}
[CHAT] Connected to HOST
[HOST] chat app loaded successfully
```

### 5. Send a Message in Chat

### 6. Watch for Notifications:
- Console: `[HOST] User performed action in chat`
- UI: Toast notification appears

### 7. Verify Message Log:
Click the "PostMessage Communication Log" at bottom of modal

## üìä What Works on Vercel

| Feature | Status | Technology |
|---------|--------|------------|
| HOST app standalone | ‚úÖ | React + Vite |
| CHAT app standalone | ‚úÖ | React + Vite |
| EMAIL app standalone | ‚úÖ | React + Vite |
| HOST ‚Üí CHAT (iframe load) | ‚úÖ | PostMessage |
| CHAT ‚Üí HOST (actions) | ‚úÖ | PostMessage |
| HOST ‚Üí EMAIL (iframe load) | ‚úÖ | PostMessage |
| EMAIL ‚Üí HOST (actions) | ‚úÖ | PostMessage |
| EventBus (within HOST) | ‚úÖ | Custom Pub/Sub |
| Notifications | ‚úÖ | EventBus + PostMessage |
| Design System | ‚ö†Ô∏è | See note below |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Design System on Vercel

**Current Issue**: CHAT and EMAIL import design system via file path alias:
```typescript
import { Button } from 'host'; // Won't work on Vercel!
```

**Solutions**:

### Option 1: Copy Design System (Quick Fix)
Before deploying CHAT/EMAIL, manually copy the design system:
```bash
cp -r host/src/designSystem chat/src/
cp -r host/src/designSystem email/src/
```

Then update imports in chat/email:
```typescript
import { Button } from './designSystem'; // Local copy
```

### Option 2: NPM Package (Best Practice)
Publish design system as npm package and install in all apps.

### Option 3: Module Federation (Advanced)
Use Vite Module Federation plugin to share components at runtime.

## üéØ Communication Events You'll See

### When Chat Loads:
```
‚úÖ "CHAT application loaded successfully" (green notification)
```

### When User Sends Chat Message:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è "Message sent in chat: [message text]" (blue notification)
```

### When Email Loads:
```
‚úÖ "EMAIL application loaded successfully" (green notification)
```

### When User Sends Email:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è "Email sent to [recipient]: [subject]" (blue notification)
```

### When User Reads Email:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è "Email read: [subject]" (blue notification)
```

### When User Stars Email:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è "Email starred: [subject]" (blue notification)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No communication on Vercel
**Solution**: Check browser console for CORS or origin errors. Update PostMessage origins.

### Issue: Design system not found
**Solution**: Copy design system to each app or use npm package.

### Issue: iframe doesn't load
**Solution**: Check VITE_CHAT_URL and VITE_EMAIL_URL environment variables.

### Issue: Notifications not showing
**Solution**: EventBus works in HOST. PostMessage sends events to EventBus which triggers notifications.

## üìù Files Modified for Communication

1. ‚úÖ `chat/src/App.tsx` - Added PostMessage support
2. ‚úÖ `email/src/App.tsx` - Added PostMessage support
3. ‚úÖ `host/src/components/MicroFrontendModal.tsx` - Enhanced message handling
4. ‚úÖ All builds passing successfully

---

## üéì Summary

Your micro-frontend architecture now supports:

- **Local Development**: All communication works via PostMessage + EventBus
- **Vercel Production**: PostMessage enables cross-VM communication
- **Bi-directional**: HOST ‚Üî CHAT and HOST ‚Üî EMAIL communication
- **Real-time Notifications**: All user actions are tracked and displayed
- **Security Ready**: Easy to add origin verification for production

**Next Steps**:
1. Deploy all three apps to Vercel
2. Update PostMessage origins with actual URLs
3. Fix Design System imports (copy or npm package)
4. Test communication on production
