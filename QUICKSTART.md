# Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Get Started in 2 Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm run install:all
```

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! Open **http://localhost:5174** in your browser.

---

## What You'll See

The terminal will show color-coded logs:
- ðŸ”µ **HOST** (Blue) - Main application on port 5174
- ðŸŸ¢ **CHAT** (Green) - Chat micro-frontend on port 5175
- ðŸŸ£ **EMAIL** (Magenta) - Email micro-frontend on port 5176

Wait for all three services to show "Local: http://localhost:517X" before opening the browser.

**From the host app (5174), click the buttons to open:**
- Chat application â†’ Opens http://localhost:5175
- Email application â†’ Opens http://localhost:5176

Each app runs independently!
